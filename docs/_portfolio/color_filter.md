In this practice the intention is to develop a color filter that allow us to segment some object in the image. You will have to get in contact with RGB and HSV color spaces, and OpenCV (python) library.

For the realization of the practice, you are provided of a framework written in python that collects the images and allows its visualization. These images will be collected through several specific videos for this practice (pelota_roja.avi and pelotas_roja_azul.avi), although you could use your own videos instead or even a camera..
