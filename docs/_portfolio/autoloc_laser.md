The objective of this practice is to implement the logic that allows a robot to self locate in space.

The goal of this practice is to implement the logic that allows a robot to self locate in space. In particular, it is about getting the robot to carry out an algorithm of self-location, using only a laser sensor, to estimate its position in a given space (of which a map has been provided).
